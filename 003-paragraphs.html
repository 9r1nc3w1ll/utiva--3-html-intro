    <h1>Paragraphs in HTML</h1>
    
    <p>
      This is a paragraph of text. HTML will automatically wrap the text and add
      appropriate spacing. Paragraphs are defined using the &lt;p&gt; element.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This is another paragraph. Notice how browsers automatically add space
      before and after each paragraph. This makes the content more readable.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Long paragraphs are also handled well by the browser, which will wrap the
      text to fit the width of the containing element or viewport. You don't need
      to worry about manually inserting line breaks in most cases.
